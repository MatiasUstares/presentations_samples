# presentations_samples
Data visualization and presentation skills samples.
The samples in this repository include the main results of my projects and others where I was a research assistant.
The codes of these projects can be found in the repository: Coding Samples.

All the presentations were elaborated in LaTex.

Questions and suggestions are more than welcome.
